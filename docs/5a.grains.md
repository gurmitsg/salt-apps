## Grains  

Get grains for a given minion
```sh
$> salt redhat-minion grains.items
```

Get the os family of all or a given minion
```sh
$> salt redhat-minion grains.item os_family
$> salt '*' grains.item os_family
```

Get salt version on the minions
``sh
$> salt '*' grains.item saltversion
```

### Set grains for minions
```sh
salt '*' grains.setval datacenter phoenix
salt '*' grains.setval apps ["web","auth","api"]
salt ubuntu-minion grains.setval role db
salt redhat-minion grains.setval role web
```

To view custom grains, ssh into any of the minions and :
```sh
$> cat /etc/salt/grains
```

Delete grains
```sh
salt '*' grains.delval datacenter
salt '*' grains.delval datacenter destructive=True
```

Other methods :      
It is also possible to assign grains statically to minions. This can be configured on the minions
either in /etc/salt/grains or /etc/salt/minion


### Creating custom grain module     
  - Create the directory /srv/salt/\_grains     
  - In the newly created directory add the file mygrain.py      
  - Add the function as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/salt/_grains/mygrain.py)
