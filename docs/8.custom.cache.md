## Custom returners/cache

This doc refers to setup of two custom returners :
  - slack
  - mongo

### Slack
  - Ensure you have have a slack channel created and an appropriate user
  - Ensure an API token has been created for the said user.
  - Create a file slack.conf (on the minions) in the directory /etc/salt/minion.d/
  - Set the contents of the configuration file as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/minion/minion.d/slack.conf).
  - Create a file ext_cache.conf in (on the master) in /etc/salt/master.d/
  - set the contents of the file as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/ext_cache.conf).
  - Ensure minions and master are restarted when conf changes are made.
  - Note: from master you can restart the minions like so :
    ```
    $> salt '*' cmd.run_bg 'salt-call --local service.restart salt-minion'
    ```

### Mongo
  - Ensure pymongo is installed in all minions :
  - For ubuntu :
    ```
    $> apt-get install python-pymongo
    ```
  - For Redhat:
    ```
    $> yum install gcc python-devel
    ```
    ```
    $> easy_install pymongo
    ```
  - Create a file mongo.conf (on all minions) in the directory /etc/salt/minion.d/
  - set the contents of the file as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/minion/minion.d/mongo.conf).
  - Edit the file (on master) /etc/salt/master.d/ext_cache.conf :
    ```
    ext_job_cache: slack,mongo
    ```
