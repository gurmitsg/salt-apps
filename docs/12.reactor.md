## Salt reactors
- View the salt event bus using eventlisten.py
- We can attempt to send events from the minions. The documentation gives more details :      
  ```
  $> salt '*' sys.doc event.send
  ```
- Example event.send        
  ```
  salt-call event.send 'salt/custom/webserver/failure' '{"region":"virginia"}'
  salt-call event.send 'salt/custom/dbserver/failure' '{"region":"virginia"}'
  ```

### Creating a simple reactor test
- Create file /srv/reactor/webserver/reactor.sls with contents as show (here)[https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/reactor/webserver/reactor.sls]        
- Create file /etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf with contents as show (here)[https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/reactor.conf]    
- Restart salt-master
- On any minion give the event.send command as mentioned above.
- The reactor should create a file /tmp/webserver_failure.txt. Check from master like so :     
  ```
  $> salt '*' file.file_exists /tmp/webserver_failed.txt
  ```

### Creating a reactor that sends a Pagerduty alert
- Create file on master /srv/reactor/dbserver/reactor.sls with contents as seen (here)[https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/reactor/dbserver/reactor.sls]    
- Create file on minion /etc/salt/minion.d/pagerduty.conf with contents as see (here)[https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/minion/minion.d/pagerduty.conf]  
- Add the following two lines to the reactor, to select the reactor as per tag glob :
```sh
- 'salt/custom/dbserver/*':
  - /srv/reactor/dbserver/reactor.sls  
```
