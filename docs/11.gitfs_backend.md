## Gitfs Backend
NOTE : remove ext_cache for this test


- Create file /etc/salt/master.d/fileserver_backend.conf with content as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/fileserver_backend.conf)     
- Create file /etc/salt/master.d/gitfs.conf with content as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/gitfs.conf)      
- Restart salt-master


## Gitfs Backend with environments
- First ensure that all minions have the environment value set in /etc/salt/minion
- Create file /etc/salt/master.d/merge.conf with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/merge.conf)
- Ensure the file /etc/salt/master.d/gitfs.conf has listed all the relevant branches and their references. For example :
```sh
gitfs_remotes:
  - https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps.git:
    - root: salt
    - saltenv:
      - base:
        - ref: master
      - develop:
        - ref: develop
      - staging:
        - ref: develop
```
