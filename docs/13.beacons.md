- Create file /srv/reactor/infra/load_reactor.sls with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/reactor/infra/load_reactor.sls)

### Creating Disk usage beacon
- Ensure that on the minions in /etc/salt/minion.d/beacon.conf contents are set like seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/minion/minion.d/beacon.conf)    
- Create file /srv/reactor/infra/disk_reactor.sls with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/reactor/infra/disk_reactor.conf)

### Creating btmp beacon
- Ensure that on the minions in /etc/salt/minion.d/beacon.conf contents are set like seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/minion/minion.d/beacon.conf)   
- Create file /srv/reactor/infra/btmp_reactor.sls with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/reactor/infra/btmp_reactor.sls)

### Creating Custom beacons
- Create file /srv/salt/\_beacons/mybeacon.py on master with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/salt/_beacons/mybeacon.py)    
- Ensure that on the minions in /etc/salt/minion.d/beacon.conf these lines are added :
```sh
  mybeacon:
    count: 32
    interval: 10
```
- Run the following command to sync the beacon :
```sh
$> salt '*' saltutil.sync_all
```

### Reactor conf on master
- Create file /etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf with contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/master/master.d/reactor.conf)
