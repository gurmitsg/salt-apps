## Salt Cloud
- Ensure salt-cloud is installed.
- First create a cloud provider configuration file. For instance in this case we will be creating VM's on AWS. Therefore create the file /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/aws_dev.conf. Set the contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/cloud/cloud.providers.d/aws_dev.conf)   
- Next create a profile to that can be used to provision vms. Create file /etc/salt/cloud.profile.d/dev_profile.conf. Set the content as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/cloud/cloud.profiles.d/dev_profile.conf)- To provision a VM based on a profile, give the following command :
```sh
$> salt-cloud -p <profile_name> <instance_name>
$> salt-cloud -p dev-web ubuntu.dev.web
$> salt-cloud -p dev-database ubuntu.dev.database
```  
- To destroy a VM provisioned from a profile :
```sh
$> salt-cloud <instance_name> -d
$> salt-cloud ubuntu.dev.database -d
```

### Creating Maps
- Create file /etc/salt/cloudmaps/dev_environment.map (we are attempting create all the VM's we need in our dev_environment with just one salt-cloud command) and set the contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/cloud/cloudmaps/dev_environment.map).   
- To provision the entire environment as specified in the map file, issue the following command (note: the -P option will create all machines in parallel) :
```sh
$> salt-cloud -m /path/to/mapfile -P
$> salt-cloud -m cloudmaps/dev_environment.map -P
```
- To delete all VM's created from a map file :
```sh
salt-cloud -m /path/to/mapfile -d
salt-cloud -m cloudmaps/dev_environment.map -d
```
