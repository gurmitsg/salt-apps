## Salt Cloud
- Ensure salt-cloud is installed.
- First create a cloud provider configuration file. For instance in this case we will be creating VM's on AWS. Therefore create the file /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/aws_dev.conf. Set the contents as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/cloud/cloud.providers.d/aws_dev.conf)   
- Next create a profile to that can be used to provision vms. Create file /etc/salt/cloud.profile.d/dev_profile.conf. Set the content as seen [here](https://github.com/nobleprog-salt/salt-apps/blob/master/config/cloud/cloud.profiles.d/dev_profile.conf)
